-- Database initialization script
-- This script runs automatically when the MySQL container is first created

-- Create database if it doesn't exist (already created by MYSQL_DATABASE env var)
-- This is a placeholder for any additional initialization needed

-- Grant privileges (handled by Docker environment variables)
-- User is created automatically by MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD

SELECT 'Database initialization completed' AS status;
