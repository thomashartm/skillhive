firebase:
  api_key: ""           # Web API Key
  auth_domain: "www.skillhive.cloud"
  project_id: "level-dragon-478821-t3"
  storage_bucket: "level-dragon-478821-t3.appspot.com"
  messaging_sender_id: "551873236818"  # Same as project number
  app_id: ""            # From Firebase console (starts with 1:...)

# Notes:
# - The api_key is NOT a secret - it's embedded in the frontend JavaScript
# - It's stored in Secret Manager for convenience, not security
# - The actual security comes from Firebase Security Rules and Auth
